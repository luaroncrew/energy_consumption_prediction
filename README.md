# energy_consumption_prediction

Eliot Veyret, Makarov Kirill

to make this predictive model we used open-data sources for 2018 year

temperature data taken from: 
https://meteonet.umr-cnrm.fr/dataset/data/SE/ground_stations/

energy consumption data from:
https://www.rte-france.com/en/eco2mix/download-indicators



What was the working plan?

* find a data for weather conditions and energy consumption
* merge all the data in one csv file (JOIN) 
* make a mathematical model for consumption based on this data
* some frontend development: a very simple interface on R to allow people to interact with model
